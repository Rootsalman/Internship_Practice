FEATURES OF JAVA
1)Object Oriented
   Everything in Java is an object. 
   Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.
        Methods...
   -->Object - Real world Examples
   -->Class -  Contains the properties and behaviours of the object
   -->Inheritance - mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
   -->Polymorphism - concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
   -->Encapsulation - process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, //for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
   -->Abstraction - process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

2)Simple
    Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand.
    -->There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.
         Java Kit will provide all the set of libraries.

3)Platform Independent
    A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
    Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc.
    which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language.

4)Secured
    Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. 
    Java is secured because:
    -->Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox

5)Portable
    Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.
    It doesn't require any implementation.

6)High-Performance
    Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. 
    It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++). 
    Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages.

7)Dynamic_language
    Java is a dynamic language. 
    It supports the dynamic loading of classes. 
    It means classes are loaded on demand. 

8)Robust
   The English mining of Robust is strong. 
   Java is robust because:
   -->It uses strong memory management.
   -->There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
   -->Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine.
   -->There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. 

9)Architecture-neutral
    Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features.
    In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture.
    However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.

10)Multi-Threaded
    A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. 
    The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread.
